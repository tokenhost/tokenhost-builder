Generated app test scaffold

This directory is emitted by `th generate --with-tests`.

- `contract/smoke.mjs` validates baseline generated app contract test preconditions.
- `ui/smoke.mjs` validates baseline generated UI route/component preconditions.

These are starter tests and are intended to be expanded with schema-specific assertions.
